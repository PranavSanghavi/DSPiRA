# Lab Modules

1. [Introduction to GNU Radio & Signals](01)
> This lab is a guided tutorial on GNU Radio including an installation guide. The guided exercises involve development of waveform generation and manipulating graphic user interfaces.           
  - [1.1. Signals Continued: Sampling](01_1) 
  > > A short exploration of random Signals and Sampling

2. [First steps with SDR Hardware](02)   
> This lab involves working with hardware i.e. the SDR dongle. We shall build a simple FM radio

3. [Introduction to Fourier Analysis](03)   
> This is an introductory exercise in Fourier Analysis by way of Harmonic Analysis using Fourier Series. 
  - [3.1. Fourier Series and Fourier Transforms](03_1)
  > > Let's find out what all this fourier fuss is all about!

4. [Filters](04)   
>  To implement filters. We shall make a an "*equalizer*" for the demodulated FM audio using the filters. Extract fundamental frequencies from a piano chord. Build a guitar tuner. 

5. [Fourier Analysis -- Expert Mode!](05)
> Revisit Fourier Transform, FT properties, IQ sampling, Optionally, Implement a simple N-point *Fast Fourier Transform*. Use the gnuradio FFT block and filters from the previous exercise to build a spectrometer. Intruduction to Polyphase filterbanks as an added upgrade to the spectrometer. 

6. [A Radio Telescope](06)    
> 1. Build an Antenna
> 2. Assemble Low Noise Amplifier
> 3. Inegration of Antenna to SDR dongle to GNU Radio companion. 

7. [Observations](07)
> 1. Making measurements
> 2. Caliberating
> 3. Mapping the neutral hydrogen
> 4. Rotation Curve of the Milky Way
