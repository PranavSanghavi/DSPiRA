# 3. Fourier Analysis

Fourier Analysis is a very powerful tool that comes into play when we discuss periodic signals. Colloquially, a periodic signal repeats.

## 3.1. Introduction

Mathematically a signal $$x(t)$$ is periodic if there exists a positive constant $$T$$ such that:
$$
x(t) = x(t + T)
$$
for all values of $$t$$. The smallest value of $$T$$ for which this is true is called the fundamental period and is denoted $$T_o$$. The corresponding *fundamental frequency* is $$f_o = \frac{1}{T_o}$$. If $$T_o$$ is in seconds, then $$f_o$$ is in Hertz (Hz). The fundamental angular frequency is $$\omega_o = 2\pi f_o$$ and is measured in rad/sec.

## 3.2. Fourier Series

A Fourier series is an expansion of a periodic function f(x) in terms of an infinite sum of sines and cosines. The computation and study of Fourier series is known as harmonic analysis and is extremely useful as a way to break up an arbitrary periodic function into a set of simple terms that can be plugged in, solved individually, and then recombined to obtain the solution to the original problem or an approximation to it to whatever accuracy is desired or practical. [^1]

Mathermatically in a simple sense an arbitrary function $$f(t)$$ can be decomposed as:

$$
f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n cos(nx) + b_n sin(nx) 
$$ 


We shall explore this concept by making two waveforms using sinosoids:

## 3.3. A Sqaure Wave

From [Lab 1](../01/), we have te function generator. We use that to make a square wave of amplitude = 1. 

Mathematically it can be written as:

$$
f(x) = 
  \begin{cases} 
   0 & \text{if } -\pi \leq x \lt 0 \\
   1       & \text{if } 0 \leq x \lt \pi
  \end{cases}\ and\ f(x+2\pi)=f(x)
$$ 

Which has a period of $$2\pi$$.  For an arbitrary period P:
$$
f(x) = 
  \begin{cases} 
   0 & \text{if } -P/2 \leq x \lt 0 \\
   1       & \text{if } 0 \leq x \lt P/2
  \end{cases}\ and\ f(x+P)=f(x)
$$


The correposdonding fourier series of the square wave
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{(2k-1)\pi} sin[(2k-1)x] \\
\ \ \ = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{\pi}sin(x) + \frac{2}{3\pi}sin(3x) + \frac{2}{5\pi}sin(5x) + \frac{2}{7\pi}sin(7x) + ... + + \frac{2}{n\pi}sin(nx)\ (\ n\ is\ odd)
$$

and for arbirary period P:
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{(2k-1)\pi} sin[\frac{2\pi}{P}(2k-1)x] \\
\ \ \ = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{\pi}sin(\frac{2\pi}{P}x) + \frac{2}{3\pi}sin(\frac{2\pi}{P}3x) + \frac{2}{5\pi}sin(\frac{2\pi}{P}5x) + \frac{2}{7\pi}sin(\frac{2\pi}{P}7x) + ... + + \frac{2}{n\pi}sin(\frac{2\pi}{P}nx)\ (\ n\ is\ odd)
$$


Use more and more sources to add additional sinusoids and see what waveform you get after each added term.  How many terms until you're square wave looks good?  5?  10?  



It should look similar to this:

This type of analysis is important for digital design in that most digital signals are square waves, representing either a 1 or a zero.  So if your signal is at 10MHz, how fast should the electronics and design work?

## 3.4. A Triangle Wave

The triangular wave is defined as:
$$
f(x)=|x|\  for\ -1\lt x \leq 1\ and\ f(x+2)=f(x)\ for\ all\ x
$$

Its corresponding fourier series is:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{2} - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{4}{(2k-1)^2\pi^2} cos[(2k-1)\pi x] \\
= \frac{1}{2} - \frac{4}{\pi^2}cos(\pi x) - \frac{4}{9\pi^2}cos(3 \pi x) - \frac{4}{25\pi^2}cos(5\pi x) - ...
$$

Make a flowgraph out of the expanded terms above and check the output after each operation. Do you need more or fewer components to begin looking like a triangle wave as compared to a square wave?  Why do you think that is?  

It should give an output like this:

## 3.5. A Sawtooth wave.

Now mathematically define a sawtooth wave and find it's fourier series expansion.  Then create its flow-graph, again with more and more fourier components.  Again, do you need more/less fourier components as compared to a square or triangle wave?
